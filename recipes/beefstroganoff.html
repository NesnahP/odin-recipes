                <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>8 ounces egg noodles, uncooked</li>

        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and browned, about 3-5 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks.  Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
                <li>Stir in beef stock, Worcestershire, Dijon and egg noodles; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and simmer until pasta is cooked through, about 9-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in sour cream until heated through, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
